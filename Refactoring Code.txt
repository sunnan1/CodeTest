I choose to refactor some of the code

1. Traits must be define to achieve code modularity
2. No proper SOLID principles practice being used
2. Define helpers for all hardcoded strings used in comparison statements so if in future developer need to change a value in hardcoded string it must be placed at a single place
4. I have mentioned comments and corrected the code
5. Instead of validating a key in if condition use Validator to validate
6. instead of using string variables in if condition as boolean variable if you want to validate if they have values use isset($variable)
7. not a good practice, define string in messages.php and call that key
8. if its an exception the message shouldn't be success it must be either danger or error
9. Instead of using with() with every relation model define scopes in Models
